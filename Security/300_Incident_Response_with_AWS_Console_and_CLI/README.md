# Level 300: Incident Response with AWS Console and CLI

## Introduction
This hands-on lab will guide you through a number of examples of how you could use the AWS Console and Command Line Interface (CLI) for responding to a security incident. The CLI is just one of many tools that can help automate your response, including gathering information, containment, and recovery.  

The skills you learn will help you secure your workloads in alignment with the [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/).

## Goals:
* Identify tooling for incident response
* Automate containment for incident response
* Pre-deploy tools for incident response

## Prerequisites:
* An [AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html) that you are able to use for testing, that is not used for production or other purposes.  
* An IAM user or role in your AWS account.  
NOTE: You will be billed for any applicable AWS resources used if you complete this lab that are not covered in the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/).
