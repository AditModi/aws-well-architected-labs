# Cost Optimize a Workload
https://wellarchitectedlabs.com 

## Introduction
 This hands-on lab will guide you through the steps to perform a baseline on your workload. It will start broad and
 high level, to provide an insight into the profile of the workload, its demand, and provide an overall efficiency
 measure. It will then iterate in detail, to categorize different workload requests and provide more detailed insight
 on the cost efficiency of a workload and its components.

The first time you perform this lab it is recommended to use the sample files supplied, then you can use your own application and billing files.
