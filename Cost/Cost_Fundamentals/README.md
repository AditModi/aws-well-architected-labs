---

## Step 5 - Monitor Usage and Cost - Visualization
Visualizing cost and usage highlights trends and allows you to gain further insights.

| | | 
|---|---|
| [![Go to lab](../../common/images/gotolab.png)](./200_4_Cost_and_Usage_Analysis/README.md) | **200 Level Lab**: This lab will utilize Amazon Athena to provide an interface to query the CUR, provide you the most common customer queries, and help you to build your own queries. |

---

## Step 8 - Monitor Usage and Cost - Advanced Visualization
Utilizing the CUR data source in the previous step, you can provide more detailed and custom visualizations and dashboards.

| | | 
|---|---|
| [![Go to lab](../../common/images/gotolab.png)](./200_5_Cost_Visualization/README.md) | **200 Level Lab**: This Lab extends the previous step, utilizing Amazon Quicksight to visualize the CUR data source. |
