## 2. Create an IAM Policy to restrict service usage by region 
To manage costs you need to manage and control your usage. AWS offers multiple regions, so depending on your business requirements you can limit access to AWS services depending on the region. This can be used to ensure usage is only allowed in specific regions which are more cost effective, and minimize associated usage and cost, such as data transfer.

We will create a policy that allows all EC2, RDS and S3 access in a single region only. NOTE: it is best practice to provide only the minimum access required, the policy used here is for brevity and simplicity, and should only be implemented as a demonstration before being removed.


### 2.1 Create the IAM Policy

1. Go to the **IAM** service page: 
![Images/AWSPolicy1.png](Images/AWSPolicy1.png)

2. Select **Policies** from the left menu:
![Images/AWSPolicy2.png](Images/AWSPolicy2.png)

3. Click **Create Policy**:
![Images/AWSPolicy3.png](Images/AWSPolicy3.png)

4. Click the **JSON** tab:
![Images/AWSPolicy4.png](Images/AWSPolicy4.png)

5. Open the following text file, copy and paste the policy into the console:
**NOTE** Ensure you copy the entire policy, including the start '{' and end '}'
<BR>
[./Code/Region_Restrict](./Code/Region_Restrict.md) 
               
6. Click **Review policy**:
![Images/AWSPolicy5.png](Images/AWSPolicy5.png)

7. Create the policy with the following details:
    - **Name**: RegionRestrict
    - **Description**: EC2, RDS, S3 access in us-east-1 only
    - Click **Create policy**: 
![Images/AWSPolicy6.png](Images/AWSPolicy6.png)

You have successfully created the Policy.


### 2.2 Apply it to a group

1. Select **Groups** from the left menu:
![Images/AWSPolicy7.png](Images/AWSPolicy7.png)

2. Click on the **CostTest** group (created previously):

![Images/AWSPolicy13.png](Images/AWSPolicy13.png)

You have successfully attached the policy to the CostTest group.

**Log out from the console**


### 2.3 Verify the policy is in effect

1. Logon to the console as the **TestUser1** user, go to the **EC2** Service dashboard: 
![Images/AWSPolicy14.png](Images/AWSPolicy14.png)

2. Click the current region in the top right, and select **US West (N.California)**: 
![Images/AWSPolicy15.png](Images/AWSPolicy15.png)

3. In the **Old look EC2 console** you will notice that there are authorization messages due to not having access in that region (the policy restricted EC2 usage to N. Virginia only), the new look EC2 console will not have errors:
![Images/AWSPolicy16.png](Images/AWSPolicy16.png)

4. Try to launch an instance by clicking **Launch Instance**:
![Images/AWSPolicy17.png](Images/AWSPolicy17.png)

5. Click on **Select** next to the **Amazon Linux 2 AMI**, You will receive an error when you select an AMI as you do not have permissions:
![Images/AWSPolicy18.png](Images/AWSPolicy18.png)

You have successfully verified that you cannot launch any instances outside of the N.Virginia region. We will now verify we have access in us-east-1 (N.Virginia):

6. Change the region by clicking the current region, and selecting **US East (N.Virginia)**:
![Images/AWSPolicy19.png](Images/AWSPolicy19.png)

7. Now attempt to launch an instance, choose the **Amazon Linux 2 AMI**, leave **64-bit (x86)** selected, click **Select**:

9. Take note of the security group created (as you need to delete it), Click **Launch**:
![Images/AWSPolicy23.png](Images/AWSPolicy23.png)

10. Select **Proceed without a key pair**, and click **I acknowledge..** checkbox, and click **Launch Instances**:
![Images/AWSPolicy24.png](Images/AWSPolicy24.png)

11. You will get a success message, click on the instance id:
![Images/AWSPolicy25.png](Images/AWSPolicy25.png)

12. Ensure the correct instance is selected, click **Actions**, then **Instance State**, then **Terminate**:
![Images/AWSPolicy26.png](Images/AWSPolicy26.png)

13. Confirm the instance ID is correct, click **Yes, Terminate**:
![Images/AWSPolicy27.png](Images/AWSPolicy27.png)

You have successfully implemented an IAM policy that restricts all EC2, RDS and S3 operations to a single region.

Log out of the console as TestUser1.

## 3. Create an IAM Policy to restrict EC2 usage by family 
AWS offers different instance families within EC2. Depending on your workload requirements - different types will be most cost effective. For non-specific environments such as testing or development, you can restrict the instance families in those accounts to the most cost effective generic types. It is also an effective way to increase RI utilization, by ensuring these accounts will consume any available Reserved Instances. 

We will create a policy that allows operations on specific instance families only. This will not only restrict launching an instance, but all other activities. NOTE: it is best practice to provide only the minimum access required, the policy used here is for brevity and simplicity, and should only be implemented as a demonstration before being removed.

## 4. Extend an IAM Policy to restrict EC2 usage by instance size 
We can also restrict the size of instance that can be launched. This can be used to ensure only low cost instances can be created within an account. This is ideal for testing and development, where high capacity instances may not be required. We will extend the EC2 family policy above, and add restrictions by adding the sizes of instances allowed.

<a name="EC2_volume_type"></a>
## 5. Create an IAM policy to restrict EBS Volume creation by volume type 
Extending cost optimization governance beyond compute instances will ensure overall higher levels of cost optimization. Similar to EC2 instances, there are different storage types. Governing the type of storage that can be created in an account can be effective to minimize cost. 

We will create an IAM policy that denies operations that contain provisioned IOPS (io1) EBS volume types. This will not only restrict creating a volume, but all other actions that attempt to use this volume type. NOTE: it is best practice to provide only the minimum access required, the policy used here is for brevity and simplicity, and should only be implemented as a demonstration before being removed.
