# Level 200: Deploy and Update CloudFormation

<https://wellarchitectedlabs.com>

## Introduction

This hands-on lab will guide you through the steps to improve reliability of a service by using automation to make changes in your cloud infrastructure. When this lab is completed, you will have deployed and edited a CloudFormation template. Using this template you will deploy a VPC, an S3 bucket and an EC2 instance running a simple web server.

The skills you learn will help you build resilient workloads in alignment with the [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/)

## Goals

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

* Automate change
* Document and track changes in code
* Implement infrastructure as a service

## Prequisites

If you are running the at an AWS sponsored workshop then you may be provided with an AWS Account to use, in which case the following pre-requisites will be satisfied by the provided AWS account.  If you are running this using your own AWS Account, then please note the following prerequisites:

* An [AWS Account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html) that you are able to use for testing. This account MUST NOT be used for production or other purposes.
* An Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or federated credentials into that account that has permissions to create IAM Roles, EC2 instances, S3 buckets, VPCs, Subnets, and Internet Gateways

NOTE: You will be billed for any applicable AWS resources used if you complete this lab that are not covered in the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/).
