# AWS Well-Architected Reliability Labs

![ReliabilityIconHorizontal](Images/ReliabilityIconHorizontal.png)

This repository contains documentation and code for hands-on-labs to help you learn how to learn, measure, and build using AWS Well-Architected best practices for reliability. The labs are categorized into levels, where 100 is introductory, 200/300 is intermediate and 400 is advanced.

**Reliability** is the ability of a workload to perform its intended function correctly and consistently when itâ€™s expected to. This includes the ability to operate and test the workload through its total lifecycle

For more information about Reliability, read the
[AWS Well-Architected Reliability whitepaper](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/architecture/AWS-Reliability-Pillar.pdf).
