## Python version using Boto3 Library
The lab uses AWS CLI to perform all of the tasks, but you can also use the Boto3 Python library to perform the same steps. As a reference, you can [download the code LabExample.py](/watool/200_Using_AWSCLI_To_Manage_WA_Reviews/Code/LabExample.py) which will perform all of the same steps.
