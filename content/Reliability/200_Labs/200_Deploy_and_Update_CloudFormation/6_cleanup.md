When a CloudFormation stack is deleted, CloudFormation will automatically delete
the resources that it created.

You will now delete the stack.

1. In the CloudFormation console, select **CloudFormationLab**.

2. Click **Delete** then click **Delete stack**

The stack will show *DELETE_IN_PROGRESS*. After a few minutes, the stack will disappear.
