## About this Guide

This quest is for you to improve your security posture. Every stakeholder involved in your organization and product or service is entitled to make use of a secure platform. Security is important to earn the trust with your customers and your providers. A secure environment also helps to protect your intellectual property. Each set of activities can be done in one day or split over a week in your lunch break. By the end of the quest we will have a set of accounts with security best practices applied, ready to develop your product in knowing that when you launch your workload you have secure foundations in place.

For more context on this quest see [Essential Security Patterns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScwoR73yr_c) from Public Sector Summit Canberra 2019 and the associated [slide deck on SlideShare](https://www.slideshare.net/AmazonWebServices/essential-security-patterns)
