Now that the CloudWatch Agent is up and running on your EC2 Instance, let’s go ahead and view those logs and metrics from the Console. CloudWatch is a useful place to view logs because it is centralized, meaning you can switch between examining logs from many sources.

**Viewing Logs:**

1. Open the [CloudWatch console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/).
2. On the left side menu, choose **Log groups** under **Logs.** On that screen, enter `securitylablogs` in the search bar. Click on the log group that appears in the results.

3. You will see these log streams: `cw-agent-logs`, `apache-access-logs`, `apache-error-logs`, `yum-logs`, and `ssh-logs`. Click through all of them to view the logs from each of these services.

4. You should see a record of log events. This is the data being collected on your EC2 instance, and then sent to CloudWatch by the CloudWatch Agent installed on the instance.

**Recap**: In this section, you explored log files generated by your EC2 instance in the CloudWatch console. The CloudWatch console provides a unified location to view a variety of logs, enabling you to investigate or monitor security activity in a central location. Using the CloudWatch console illustrates the security best practice of “analyzing logs, findings, and metrics centrally”.
